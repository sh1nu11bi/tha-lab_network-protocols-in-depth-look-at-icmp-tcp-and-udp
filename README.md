### NETWORK PROTOCOLS - IN-DEPTH LOOK AT ICMP, TCP, AND UDP

#### Purpose
The main goal of this lab is to introduce you to the three main protocols you will generally encounter most often when dealing with networking. In this exercise we are going to analyze network traffic in Wireshark to better understand the protocols and their implementation specifics as discussed in the lecture video.

#### Requirements
This lab requires the following THA virtual machines
* Kali

#### Lab Credentials

* Kali VM: `root / toor`

#### Setup
1. Boot your THA Kali VM and login.

2. Clone this repo on your Kali VM by opening a terminal and issuing the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/madsec/tha-lab_network-protocols-in-depth-look-at-icmp-tcp-and-udp /root/THA/network-protocols
    ```

##### Note
* If the Kali VM network connection continually disconnects simply reboot the VM.

#### Start the lab
* Follow the instructions for lab 1 found on your Kali machine at 
  ```
  /root/THA/network-protocols/lab1.md
  ```
