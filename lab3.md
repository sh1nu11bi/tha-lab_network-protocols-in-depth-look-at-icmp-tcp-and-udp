#### TCP TEARDOWN
1. Open the network capture file `/root/THA/network-protocols/assets/3wayhandshake.pcap` on your THA Kali VM using the Wireshark application.
2. Using what you learned in the lesson regarding the TCP teardown process answer the following questions using Wireshark: What IP initiated the TCP Teardown sequence? Was this IP the server or client?What other TCP Flags were set in this packet? Was this a graceful teardown or an abrupt teardown process?
3. You have completed this lab. You can continue to lab 4 by following the instructions found at
