1. Start a network capture and use a web browser to visit at least 5 websites of your choice.  Stop the network capture and utilize Wireshark to identify the TCP connection establishment and teardown processes.
2. From the previous network capture attempt to identify the DNS requests associated with each website domain name request.  Analyze the protocol decodes for these requests to identify what record types were being returned and other interesting characteristics such as TTL values in the DNS responses.
